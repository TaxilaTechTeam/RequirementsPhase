6. we can even try to make that search option in our website if thats possible. It will definetly help our visitors to serach for something in our website.
7. we can have a post comment field in which comments could be shown.
8. After we are done with our main heading section we can think about the News section which is very important for our website as your group would be conducting different events and we have to show those events in the News Section.
9. After completing the news section we can have a look at the side bar section which would contain  different Events , it would be good to keep these events on the sidebar as we dont want to overcrowd the top tabs.
